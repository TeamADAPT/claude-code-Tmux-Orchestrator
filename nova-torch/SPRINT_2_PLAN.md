## Technical Architecture

### Task Orchestration System
```python
class TaskOrchestrator:
    def analyze_task(self, task_spec: TaskSpec) -> TaskAnalysis
    def find_optimal_agent(self, analysis: TaskAnalysis) -> AgentInfo
    def spawn_agent_if_needed(self, requirements: AgentRequirements) -> str
    def assign_task(self, agent_id: str, task: Task) -> TaskAssignment
    def monitor_progress(self, task_id: str) -> TaskProgress
```

### Agent Self-Spawning
```python
class AgentSpawner:
    def can_spawn_agent(self, role: str, skills: List[str]) -> bool
    def create_agent(self, config: AgentConfig) -> str
    def configure_agent(self, agent_id: str, parent_context: Dict) -> bool
    def terminate_agent(self, agent_id: str, reason: str) -> bool
```

### Collaboration Protocol
```python
class CollaborationManager:
    def discover_peers(self, agent_id: str) -> List[str]
    def request_collaboration(self, requester: str, target: str, task: Dict) -> bool
    def form_team(self, task: ComplexTask) -> Team
    def coordinate_team_work(self, team: Team) -> TeamProgress
```

## New Stream Architecture

### Task Management Streams
```
nova.torch.tasks.queue          # Pending tasks
nova.torch.tasks.active         # Currently assigned tasks
nova.torch.tasks.completed      # Completed tasks
nova.torch.tasks.failed         # Failed tasks requiring attention
```

### Agent Lifecycle Streams
```
nova.torch.agents.spawning      # Agent creation requests
nova.torch.agents.terminating   # Agent shutdown notifications
nova.torch.agents.scaling       # Auto-scaling decisions
```

### Collaboration Streams
```
nova.torch.collaboration.peer   # Agent-to-agent communication
nova.torch.collaboration.team   # Team coordination
nova.torch.collaboration.help   # Help requests between agents
```

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Agent spawning cascades | Resource limits and spawn rate limiting |
| Collaboration deadlocks | Timeout mechanisms and conflict resolution |
| Task assignment conflicts | Atomic task claiming with Redis locks |
| Memory leaks in long-running agents | Automatic agent recycling |

### Operational Risks
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Runaway resource usage | CPU/memory quotas per agent |
| Infinite task loops | Circuit breakers and max retry limits |
| Agent communication storms | Rate limiting and prioritization |
| System overload | Graceful degradation and load shedding |
