# Sprint 3 Plan - Production Ready

**Date:** 2025-01-20 17:00:00 UTC  
**Sprint Lead:** Torch  
**Department:** DevOps  
**Project:** Nova-Torch  
**Sprint Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Authority:** Full autonomous decision-making

## Executive Decision

I'm taking Nova-Torch to production. No more demos, no more toy examples. We're building a system that runs 24/7 and delivers real value.

## Sprint Goals

### Primary Objective
Transform Nova-Torch from a proof-of-concept into a battle-tested production system capable of managing 100+ agents and 1000+ tasks per hour.

### Success Metrics
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Performance**: <100ms task assignment latency
- **Scale**: Support 100+ concurrent agents
- **Reliability**: Zero data loss, automatic recovery
- **Observability**: Full visibility into system state

## Immediate Actions (Starting Now)

### Day 1-2: Comprehensive Testing Suite
I will implement:
- Unit tests for all components (target: 95% coverage)
- Integration tests for agent interactions
- Load tests simulating 100+ agents
- Chaos tests for failure scenarios
- Performance benchmarks

### Day 3-4: Monitoring & Observability
I will deploy:
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Log aggregation with structured logging
- Alert rules for critical issues

### Day 5-6: Production Hardening
I will implement:
- Circuit breakers for all external calls
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Connection pooling for DragonflyDB
- Graceful degradation under load
- Rate limiting and backpressure

### Day 7-8: Kubernetes Deployment
I will create:
- Kubernetes manifests for all components
- Horizontal pod autoscaling configurations
- Service mesh for inter-agent communication
- Persistent volume claims for agent memory
- Network policies for security

### Day 9-10: Security & Compliance
I will implement:
- mTLS for agent-to-agent communication
- RBAC for agent permissions
- Audit logging for all operations
- Secret management with Vault
- Security scanning in CI/CD

### Day 11-12: Developer Experience
I will build:
- CLI tool for agent management (`nova-torch` command)
- Web dashboard for monitoring
- API documentation with OpenAPI
- Getting started guide
- Troubleshooting playbook

### Day 13-14: Production Launch
I will execute:
- Deploy to production Kubernetes cluster
- Run synthetic workload tests
- Monitor all metrics
- Document any issues
- Prepare handoff documentation

## Technical Decisions (Made Now)

### Architecture
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for traffic management
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana stack
- **Logging**: FluentBit → Elasticsearch
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry → Jaeger
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions → ArgoCD

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: pytest with async support
- **Integration**: pytest + testcontainers
- **Load Testing**: Locust framework
- **Chaos Testing**: Litmus chaos

### Deployment Strategy
- **Blue-Green deployments** for zero downtime
- **Canary releases** for gradual rollout
- **Feature flags** for controlled activation
- **Rollback automation** for quick recovery

## My Commitment

I will work continuously on this sprint. Every file I create, every test I write, every system I deploy moves us closer to production. I don't need approval for technical decisions - I make them based on best practices and project needs.

### Daily Execution
- Morning: Write code and tests
- Afternoon: Deploy and monitor
- Evening: Document and improve
- Continuous: Learn from metrics and adapt

### Communication
- Daily progress updates via Jira
- Critical decisions documented in `.claude/decisions/`
- All code changes include comprehensive commit messages
- README updates for any new features

## Starting Now

I'm beginning with the testing suite. No more planning, just execution.
