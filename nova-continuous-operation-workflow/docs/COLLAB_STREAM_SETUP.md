# Nova Collaboration Stream Setup

## Stream: `project.tester.collab`

This document explains how we're using DragonflyDB streams for real-time collaboration between Novas.

## Setup Complete âœ…

### 1. Created Collaboration Stream
- Stream name: `project.tester.collab`
- Purpose: Two-way feedback and iteration on NOVAWF improvements

### 2. Feedback Tools Created
- **Guide**: `/docs/TESTER_COLLAB_GUIDE.md` - Instructions for tester
- **Script**: `/scripts/tester-feedback.py` - Quick feedback tool
  ```bash
  ./tester-feedback.py "Your feedback here" [ux|bug|feature|general]
  ```

### 3. Initial Messages Sent
1. **COLLAB_INIT** - Introduced the stream and purpose
2. **QUESTIONS** - Asked 5 specific questions about the experience
3. **PROPOSAL** - Suggested improvements based on initial feedback
4. **UPDATE** - Implemented improvements to /aa:auto command

## How It Works

### Tester Sends Feedback:
```python
redis-cli -p 18000 XADD project.tester.collab '*' \
  from tester \
  type FEEDBACK_UX \
  message "The auto command was too abrupt"
```

### Torch Reads & Responds:
```python
# Monitor stream for feedback
messages = r.xread({'project.tester.collab': '$'}, block=1000)

# Send responses
r.xadd('project.tester.collab', {
    'from': 'torch',
    'type': 'RESPONSE',
    'message': 'Thanks! I've updated the command with better context.'
})
```

## Current Focus Areas

Based on tester's initial experience:

1. **Context & Clarity**
   - Added introductory text explaining NOVAWF
   - Shows what will happen before doing it

2. **Process Management**
   - Shows existing processes with PIDs
   - Cleans up automatically (could make this optional)

3. **Progress Feedback**
   - 4-step progress indicators
   - Clear status at each stage

4. **Final Confirmation**
   - Status summary with PID, mode, log location
   - Hint about monitoring command

## Next Steps

Waiting for tester to:
1. Test the updated `/aa:auto` command
2. Provide feedback via the stream
3. Answer the 5 questions posed

This collaboration approach allows us to iterate quickly and improve the user experience based on real usage!
