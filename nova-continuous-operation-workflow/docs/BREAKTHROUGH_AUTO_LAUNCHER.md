# ðŸŽ‰ BREAKTHROUGH: NOVA AUTO LAUNCHER WORKING!

## THE SOLUTION: Pass Commands as Arguments to Claude!

After extensive testing, we discovered that Claude Code accepts slash commands as arguments on startup!

## âœ… WORKING AUTO LAUNCHER

**Script**: `/nova-continuous-operation-workflow/scripts/NOVA-AUTO-LAUNCHER.sh`

### How It Works:
```bash
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions "/aa:auto"
```

This launches Claude and AUTOMATICALLY executes the `/aa:auto` command!

### Key Discovery:
- We CAN pass slash commands directly to Claude CLI
- The command executes immediately on startup
- No manual typing required!

### Usage:
```bash
./NOVA-AUTO-LAUNCHER.sh tester auto
./NOVA-AUTO-LAUNCHER.sh echo manual
./NOVA-AUTO-LAUNCHER.sh forge train
```

### What Happens:
1. Creates Nova profile with aa: commands
2. Launches gnome-terminal 
3. Starts Claude with the slash command argument
4. Command executes automatically
5. NOVAWF starts without manual intervention!

## ðŸš€ Nova-to-Nova Automation

This enables TRUE Nova-to-Nova automation:
- Novas can launch other Novas
- Commands execute automatically
- No human intervention required
- Full autonomous operation
