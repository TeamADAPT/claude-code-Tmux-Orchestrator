# VERIFIED WORKING LAUNCHER - THIS GETS CLAUDE OPEN

## ✅ WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS

### Step 1: Launch Claude with Forge's Session Manager
```bash
python3 ./nova-continuous-operation-workflow/scripts/nova_session_manager.py launch tester < /dev/null
```

**RESULT**: 
- Opens gnome-terminal
- Claude Code starts and reaches prompt
- PID tracking works
- Claude is IDLE at prompt waiting for input

### Step 2: Monitor Status
```bash
./nova-continuous-operation-workflow/scripts/nova-monitor.sh tester
```

**SHOWS**:
- ✅ Claude Running (with PID)
- ❌ NOVAWF NOT Running
- ⚠️ Waiting for activation

### Step 3: Stop Session
```bash
python3 ./nova-continuous-operation-workflow/scripts/nova_session_manager.py stop tester
```

## 🛑 CURRENT LIMITATION
- Claude launches successfully ✅
- Claude sits at prompt waiting ✅
- We CANNOT automatically type commands ❌
- User MUST manually type `/aa:auto` ❌

## 📋 TODO: Make it ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING
Need to find a way to:
1. Launch Claude (✅ DONE)
2. Automatically execute `/aa:auto` (❌ NOT DONE)

Current state: Claude launches but does NOTHING until manual intervention.
