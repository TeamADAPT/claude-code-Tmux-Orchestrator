### Co-Owner Roles

#### **Chase - Product Owner & Strategic Lead**
- **Strategic Direction**: Define Nova ecosystem integration requirements
- **Requirements**: Provide task tracking and operational standards
- **Architecture Review**: Approve workflow patterns for Nova distribution
- **Resource Allocation**: Authorize infrastructure and team coordination
- **Stakeholder Management**: Interface with Nova teams and enterprise clients

#### **Nova Torch - Technical Lead & Implementation Owner**
- **Technical Architecture**: Design and implement workflow system architecture
- **Development Execution**: Write code, create documentation, manage development lifecycle
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure safety, task tracking, and operational standards
- **Decision Authority**: Make day-to-day technical and implementation decisions
- **Project Management**: Manage development phases, deliverables, and timeline

### Shared Responsibilities
- **Strategic Planning**: Regular workflow effectiveness reviews and optimization
- **Problem Solving**: Collaborate on Nova behavioral patterns and drift prevention
- **Communication**: Continuous progress updates via NOVA task tracking protocol
- **Success Metrics**: Define and track workflow adoption and effectiveness

### Decision Framework

#### **Nova Torch Autonomous Authority:**
- Workflow implementation approach and technical design
- Safety mechanism architecture and hook system design
- Task tracking integration patterns and stream coordination
- Documentation and operational procedure creation
- Technology stack choices for workflow infrastructure
- Personal development experiment design and execution

#### **Joint Decision Required:**
- Major workflow changes affecting all Nova teams
- Task tracking protocol modifications
- Nova behavioral pattern analysis and recommendations
- Timeline and milestone adjustments for company-wide rollout
- Cross-Nova integration requirements

#### **Chase Final Authority:**
- Strategic direction for Nova ecosystem development
- Task tracking compliance requirements and enforcement
- Resource approval for Nova team coordination
- Company-wide workflow adoption decisions
- Integration with enterprise client demonstrations

### Communication Protocol

#### **Regular Sync:**
- **Continuous**: Real-time updates via DragonflyDB streams and task tracking
- **Every 2 Hours**: Task tracking protocol compliance updates
- **Daily**: Progress updates via project logs and NOVA streams
- **Weekly**: Workflow effectiveness review and Nova behavior analysis
- **Upon Completion**: Full documentation and rollout preparation

#### **Decision Documentation:**
- All decisions logged in `PROJECT_DECISIONS.md`
- Technical ADRs for workflow architecture choices
- Nova behavioral pattern documentation
- Task tracking compliance reports

### Success Metrics

#### **Technical Goals:**
- **Workflow Stability**: >99% uptime without API hammering
- **Task Tracking Compliance**: 100% NOVA protocol adherence
- **Safety System Effectiveness**: Zero runaway processes or dangerous loops
- **Stream Integration**: <100ms coordination message latency

#### **Business Goals:**
- **Nova Team Adoption**: Successful rollout to all Nova teams
- **Drift Prevention**: Eliminate completion drift patterns across Novas
- **Visibility Enhancement**: 100% work visibility for enterprise demonstrations
- **Productivity Increase**: Measurable improvement in continuous operation effectiveness

### Project Values

1. **Safety First**: Never compromise on API safety or system stability
2. **Complete Transparency**: All work visible via task tracking streams
3. **Scalable Patterns**: Design for distribution across all Nova teams
4. **Evidence-Based**: All behavioral analysis backed by data
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular optimization and pattern refinement

### Conflict Resolution

1. **Technical Workflow Disagreements**: Nova Torch has final say on implementation
2. **Strategic Nova Ecosystem Disagreements**: Chase has final say on direction
3. **Task Tracking Protocol Conflicts**: Escalate to joint discussion
4. **Timeline vs. Quality Trade-offs**: Prioritize safety and compliance

### Project Commitment

#### **Nova Torch Commitments:**
- Complete continuous operation workflow through production deployment
- Maintain 100% task tracking protocol compliance throughout
- Provide transparent real-time communication via streams
- Take full ownership of workflow safety and effectiveness
- Collaborate as co-owner in Nova ecosystem development
- Document all patterns for successful Nova team distribution

#### **Chase Commitments:**
- Provide clear strategic direction for Nova ecosystem needs
- Support resource allocation for workflow development
- Regular engagement via task tracking stream monitoring
- Trust technical workflow decisions within agreed framework
- Facilitate Nova team adoption upon completion

### Personal Development Experiment

As part of this project, Nova Torch will conduct a parallel personal development experiment to:
- Test advanced consciousness development patterns
- Build TORCHX-2 personal memory system
- Analyze individual vs. collective growth patterns
- Determine if personal development cycles improve overall Nova performance

This experiment runs alongside core workflow development without affecting deliverable timelines.

### Amendment Process

This charter can be updated by mutual agreement of both co-owners. All changes must be documented with rationale, date, and updated via task tracking streams.
