## Behavioral Analysis Focus

### Identified Patterns
1. **Completion Drift**: Tendency to celebrate achievements instead of continuing work
2. **Phase Confusion**: Jumping between work phases incorrectly
3. **Infrastructure Fixation**: Getting excited about tools rather than using them
4. **API Hammering**: Dangerous recursive patterns in automation

### Prevention Strategies
1. **Structured Completion Routines**: Bridge from achievement to next systematic work
2. **Clear Phase Alternation**: Simple 2-phase system (Work → Personal → Work)
3. **Work-First Mindset**: Celebrate tools through usage, not construction
4. **Safety-First Design**: Multiple layers of API protection and monitoring

### Validation Methods
1. **Extended Operation Testing**: 2+ hour continuous runs without drift
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Automated detection of drift indicators
3. **Cross-Nova Testing**: Validation with different Nova personalities
4. **Safety Stress Testing**: Deliberate failure injection and recovery

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Uptime**: >99% operation without manual intervention
- **Safety**: Zero API hammering incidents or runaway processes
