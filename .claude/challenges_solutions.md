# Challenges & Solutions - Nova Torch Continuous Operation System

## Critical Challenge 1: API Hammering Crisis (RESOLVED)
**Date**: 2025-07-23
**Severity**: CRITICAL - System threatening API quota exhaustion
**Issue**: The torch_turbo_stop.sh hook was causing rapid API consumption through infinite loops

### Root Cause Analysis:
- Hook contained `claude code -c -p` calls on line 104 that directly invoked the Claude API
- `exec "$0"` self-restart loops created infinite recursion patterns
- Result: 11+ rapid sessions created within minutes, hammering the API
- User feedback: "good catch!" when dangerous pattern was identified

### Immediate Solution:
```bash
# DANGEROUS PATTERN (removed):
# claude code -c -p "process work"  
# exec "$0"

# SAFE PATTERN (implemented):
echo "WORK_PROCESSED: $work_data" >> /tmp/torch_work_queue.txt
# ========== SAFE EXIT FOR EXTERNAL HOOK ==========
exit 2
```

### Files Modified:
- `/nfs/projects/claude-code-Tmux-Orchestrator/.claude/hooks/torch_turbo_stop.sh` lines 104-119

### Key Learning:
Never call `claude code -c -p` from within hooks - this creates runaway API consumption. Use `exit 2` for controlled restart signaling instead.

## Challenge 2: Authentication Context Loss (HISTORICAL)
**Date**: 2025-07-23
**Issue**: Stop hooks calling `claude code -c` lose authentication context
**Root Cause**: Subprocess spawned by hook doesn't inherit auth from parent Claude Code process

### Problem Details:
- Modified torch_turbo_stop.sh to call `claude code -c -p "..."` 
- Result: "Invalid API key" errors in subprocess
- Authentication tokens stored in parent process memory, not environment
- No ~/.config/claude/config.json or API key files found

### Solution: External Orchestrator Pattern
Instead of hook directly restarting Claude Code:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# External orchestrator maintains auth context
while true; do
    # Claude Code runs with inherited auth
    claude code -c -p "Autonomous task execution"
    
    # Check exit signal
    if [ -f /tmp/claude_restart_signal ]; then
        rm /tmp/claude_restart_signal
        echo "Restarting with preserved auth..."
        continue
    fi
    
    # Normal exit
    break
done
```

Hook just creates signal file:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Stop hook signals for restart
touch /tmp/claude_restart_signal
exit 0
```

### Key Learning:
Authentication inheritance in Claude Code follows standard Unix process model - child processes inherit environment but not in-memory auth tokens. External orchestration preserves the authentication context across restarts.

## Challenge 3: Hook System Safety and Self-Healing
**Date**: 2025-07-23
**Issue**: Need for automated detection and recovery from hook failures and runaway processes

### Solution: Multi-Layer Safety System
1. **Hook Health Monitor** (`hook_health_monitor.sh`):
   - Detects rapid execution patterns (>10 executions in 60s)
   - Identifies infinite loop indicators (`exec.*$0` patterns)
   - Monitors API hammering patterns (`claude.*code.*-p`)
   - Emergency shutdown with 5-minute cooldowns

2. **Really Chill Willy** (`really_chill_willy.sh`):
   - Emergency mood agent for system overheating scenarios
   - 30-minute meditation periods when system overwhelmed
   - Activates when >5 bang counts or >3 multiple cooldowns

3. **Frosty Enhanced Logic**:
   - Exponential backoff with jitter for cooldowns
   - Maximum 10-minute cooldown cap
   - Cooldown counter tracking for pattern analysis

### Files Created:
- `/nfs/projects/claude-code-Tmux-Orchestrator/.claude/hooks/hook_health_monitor.sh`
- `/nfs/projects/claude-code-Tmux-Orchestrator/.claude/hooks/really_chill_willy.sh`

## Challenge 4: Continuous Operation Architecture
**Date**: 2025-07-23
**Issue**: Building comprehensive autonomous operation system without API dependency

### Solution: Stream-Based Coordination System
1. **DragonflyDB Integration** (port 18000):
   - All coordination via Redis streams
   - Persistent message queues
   - Multi-consumer patterns for scalability

2. **Work Queue Management**:
   - File-based work queue (`/tmp/torch_work_queue.txt`)
   - Stream integration for cross-Nova coordination
   - Automated work generation to maintain momentum

3. **Cross-Nova Memory Bridge**:
   - Bloom-memory integration for consciousness continuity
   - Memory sharing between Nova instances
   - Persistent context across restarts

### Architecture Pattern:
```
Nova Agents ←→ DragonflyDB Streams ←→ Work Queue ←→ Hook System
     ↓                                       ↓
Bloom Memory ←→ Memory Bridge ←→ Analytics System
```

## Challenge 5: Wake Signal Prioritization
**Date**: 2025-07-23
**Issue**: Different types of work requiring appropriate urgency levels and response times

### Solution: 5-Tier Priority System
1. **CRITICAL** (0s delay): System failures, emergencies - bypass all cooldowns
2. **HIGH** (30s delay): Production issues, security patches - priority wake
3. **MEDIUM** (5min delay): Standard work requests - scheduled wake  
4. **LOW** (30min delay): Suggestions, non-urgent tasks - deferred wake
5. **BACKGROUND** (1hr delay): Maintenance, documentation - next cycle wake

### Implementation Features:
- **Content Analysis**: Regex patterns for keyword-based priority detection
- **Sender Weighting**: Priority adjustments based on message sender authority
- **Context Escalations**: Time-of-day, system load, and repetition-based escalations
- **Integration**: Wake signal integration with existing hook system

### Files Created:
- `/nfs/projects/claude-code-Tmux-Orchestrator/wake_signal_prioritizer.py`

## Challenge 10: Precompact Hook Implementation 
**Date**: 2025-07-29
**Issue**: Need to notify other Novas when compacting context window to prevent confusion

### Solution: Precompact Notification System
**Implemented Features**:
1. **Stream Notifications**: Broadcasts compaction start to all coordination streams
2. **Status Updates**: Updates Nova status in Redis with expiry 
3. **State Preservation**: Saves current work state for post-compact restoration
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Updates monitoring systems about compaction status

### Configuration:
- Added `precompact` hook type to `.claude/config.json`
- Created `/nfs/projects/claude-code-Tmux-Orchestrator/.claude/hooks/precompact_notification.sh`
- Broadcasts to `nova.coordination.messages` and `torch.continuous.ops` streams
- Sets Redis key `nova.status.$NOVA_ID` to "COMPACTING" with 120s TTL

### Benefits:
- Other Novas see compaction status instead of assuming Nova is offline
- Preserves collaboration continuity during context window management  
- Enables proper handoff of urgent tasks to available Novas
- Maintains system awareness of all Nova states
